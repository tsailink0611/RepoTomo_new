# Production Issues - Action Required

## ðŸš¨ URGENT: Security Policy Fix Required

**Issue**: Supabase Storage policies currently set to allow all operations (`true`)
**Risk**: Anyone can upload/download files without authentication
**Action**: Replace test policies with proper authentication-based policies before production

## ðŸ”‘ API Key Rotation Needed

**Issue**: API keys and tokens committed to repository during development
**Action**: Rotate all keys before production deployment:
- LINE_CHANNEL_ACCESS_TOKEN
- LINE_CHANNEL_SECRET  
- Supabase keys if needed

## ðŸ“¡ LINE Webhook Security

**Issue**: Webhook deployed with `--no-verify-jwt` flag for testing
**Action**: Re-deploy with proper JWT verification for production

## ðŸ’¾ Database Optimization

**Suggestion**: Add indexes for better performance:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_submissions_user_id ON submissions(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_submissions_report_id ON submissions(report_id);
```
