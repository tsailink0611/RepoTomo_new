## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUES FOR PRODUCTION

### üõ°Ô∏è Issue #1: Supabase Storage Security Policies - URGENT
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION  
**Current State**: All RLS policies set to `true` (allows everything)

**Problem**: 
- Current storage policies allow unrestricted access
- Anyone can upload/download files without authentication
- Production deployment requires proper security policies

**Required Actions**:
1. Replace test policies with proper authenticated user policies
2. Implement file access control based on user roles
3. Add file size and type restrictions
4. Set up proper CORS policies

**Recommended Policies**:
```sql
-- Remove test policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations 1qss87y_*" ON storage.objects;

-- Add secure policies
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT TO authenticated 
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'report-files' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "Users can access own files" ON storage.objects  
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (bucket_id = 'report-files');
```

### üîê Issue #2: Environment Variable Security
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è REVIEW REQUIRED

**Problem**:
- `.env.local` contains sensitive API keys
- LINE Bot tokens exposed in repository
- Supabase keys need rotation for production

**Required Actions**:
1. Rotate all API keys before production deployment
2. Use environment-specific configurations
3. Implement proper secret management

---

### üì± Issue #3: LINE Bot Webhook Security  
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MODERATE PRIORITY

**Problem**:
- Webhook currently deployed with `--no-verify-jwt` for testing
- Production needs proper JWT verification

**Required Actions**:
1. Re-deploy LINE webhook with proper JWT verification
2. Test webhook security in production environment
3. Implement proper error handling for rejected requests

---

### üóÑÔ∏è Issue #4: Database Performance Optimization
**Status**: üìù ENHANCEMENT

**Considerations**:
- Add database indexes for frequently queried columns
- Implement proper database backup strategy
- Consider connection pooling for high traffic

**Suggested Optimizations**:
```sql
-- Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_submissions_user_id ON submissions(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_submissions_report_id ON submissions(report_id);  
CREATE INDEX idx_staff_active ON staff(is_active) WHERE is_active = true;
```

---

### üé® Issue #5: UI/UX Polish
**Status**: üìù NICE TO HAVE

**Areas for Improvement**:
- File upload progress indicators
- Better error messaging for failed uploads
- Loading states during file operations
- File preview functionality

---

## üöÄ Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Going Live:
- [ ] Fix all storage security policies (#1)
- [ ] Rotate API keys and secrets (#2)  
- [ ] Re-deploy LINE webhook with JWT verification (#3)
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Test all functionality in production environment
- [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures

### Performance Testing:
- [ ] Load test file upload functionality
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness on actual devices
- [ ] Verify LINE Bot response times
- [ ] Database query performance review

## üìã How to Return to This Version

```bash
# Switch to this specific completion state
git checkout feature/claude-code-development
git reset --hard 50d4d2d

# Or create a new branch from this point
git checkout -b stage1-production-ready 50d4d2d
```

## üìû Support Notes

**Database Schema**: All tables properly configured with `file_urls` column added to submissions  
**Storage Bucket**: `report-files` bucket created and configured (‚ö†Ô∏è needs security update)  
**Authentication**: Working with staff ID validation system  
**LINE Integration**: Fully functional with system notifications
